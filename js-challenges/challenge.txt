1. FizzBuzz Challenge:
   Write a function that takes in a number as input and returns "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if divisible by 5, and "FizzBuzz" if divisible by both. Otherwise, return the number itself.

2. Reverse String:
   Write a JavaScript function called reverseString that takes a string as input and returns the reverse of that string using a loop.

3. Palindrome Checker:
   Implement a function to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward) using loops and if statements.

4. Prime Number Checker:
   Write a function to determine whether a given positive integer is a prime number or not using loops and conditionals.

5. Array Sum:
   Create a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the numbers in the array.

6. Maximum Number in Array:
   Write a function to find the maximum number in a given array of numbers using loops and conditional statements.

7. Even or Odd Counter:
   Implement a function that takes an array of integers and counts the number of even and odd numbers separately. Return an object with the counts for each.

8. Vowel Counter:
   Create a function that takes a string as input and counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) using loops and conditionals.

9. Factorial Calculation:
   Create a function to calculate the factorial of a given non-negative integer using a loop. Factorial of a number 'n' is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to 'n'.
   - For example, calculateFactorial(5) should return 120 because 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

10. Number Reversal:
   Write a function called reverseNumber that takes an integer as input and returns its reverse. Use a while loop to achieve this.
